Step1
	- Find the original template file by browsing through code or checking http://api.drupal.org


Step2
	- Copy and paste it into your theme directory. No need to change file name. If you change file name, it is "Theme hook or Theme hood suggestions". Make sure you follow the its rules. 


Step3
	- Clear the site cache and reload!


Tip
	- A quick way to ensure that Drupal is using the template file you’ve just overridden in your theme is to add text to the top of the template file, like “Hello World.” If your text appears when you reload, you’ll know you’re working with the correct file.
