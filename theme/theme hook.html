<ul>theme hooks refer to 
	<li>template files</li> and 
	<li>functions that have been specifically registered via hook_theme()</li>
</ul>

<h1>both share the same exact theme hook, e.g.: node.tpl.php, theme_node()</h1>

<h1>Both can take advantage of preprocess functions, which allow you to intercept and alter variables before rendering.</h1>
