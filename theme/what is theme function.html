what is theme function?


The purpose of a theme function is the same as a template file in that its goal is to provide HTML markup in a way that makes it customizable by themes (and modules, too). 


There are many, many theme functions in Drupal core, from form elements to menu items to full administration page implementations.

Using theme hook suggestions with theme functions simply means that you can choose to override a theme function in a specific context as opposed to overriding the base theme function, which would have a site-wide effect.
